# google-homepage
This is my first ever built from the ground up web-project where I attempted to recreate the Google Search Page. 

Although I’m not saying anything new to someone who knows coding, this task really hit home for me the idea that coding is more an art that a science. I first did my layout using google searches for anything I didn’t know and built my site. Then, I went and read all the other students code as well as the original source code from Google, and it was fascinating to me how different all the codes were. I must have read through 20 other pages of code for the same-looking website and no two were the same. For me, this reinforces the creative and design aspect that I enjoy with coding. However, I do want to make sure that I still try to keep in mind best practices and making things as simple and efficient as possible. I realize although there are many ways to create the same product, there are definitely some better than others.
